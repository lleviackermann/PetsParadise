        "I was a little worried to try this website since they have started very recently. But it turned out to be good and cost effective.. My dog, 55kg Rottweiler, ate less when I introduced this food to him, but eventually got used to it.I will recommend this product.",

        "The pellet size is mini and floats on water and ideal for small fish. My platy and swordtail love it and eat with gusto, no leftovers ever. It doesn't cloud the water. After using it for 2 months, I think this is a good brand of fish food.",

        "The Whisker's chicken loaf meal also contains essential vitamins and minerals, so this premium palate for your cat delivers a mouth-watering feast, without compromising on the goodness. It gives my cat the satisfying taste of premium cat food.",
